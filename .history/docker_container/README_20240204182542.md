# DEVELOP A DOCKER IMAGE FOR YOUR APPLICATION 
In this directory we will create our custom docker image , after which we will upload it to the docker registry for later use with Minikube.

You can also use a private registry hosted in a docker container , check the [private_registry](./private_registry/) directory for instructions.

## NOW WE NEED TO CREATE OUR CUSTOM IMAGE 

We need to create a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) where we put our application and we can use docker compose to test if the image is builded in the right way.
We also put our app.py , templates/ and static/ in a directory that we will name "application/" , we need to copy this directory inside the docker image to use it as our working directory. 
We will use docker-compose to test the image because we need a database to let the app run correctly.



## PUSH THE IMAGE TO THE DOCKER REGISTRY 

Now, what we need to do is push our image to the Docker Hub registry to later use it in a Kubernetes deployment. Before pushing, we need to log in to Docker Hub if we haven't already. 

                docker login 

After that, we need to tag the image.

                docker tag py_app:0.1 dockersimon97/py_app:0.1

Finally, we can push it to the Docker registry.

                docker push dockersimon97/py_app:0.1
