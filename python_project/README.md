The project need a python code that interact with database and update and report our "to do list", and after that , one frontend to have a dashboard where we can operate.

# FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO WRITE CODE IN PYTHON

You can just see the basic_command.py , a simple script made to have an idea of how python manage data and how you can use it to manage your data.

# NOW WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS FLASK AND HOW IT WORKS

Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It provides tools, libraries, and technologies for building web applications, and it follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard.

Now with flask you can do a lot of things , but we just want to use it for routing and DB connection , so we will use SQLalchemy , a pyhton library that allows you to create a connection to a db.
