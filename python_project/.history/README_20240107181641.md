## THIS IS A "TO DO LIST" PROJECT IN PYTHON MADE TO BE DEPLOYED ON MINIKUBE 

The project need a python code that interact with database and update and report our "to do list", and after that , one frontend to have a dashboard where we can operate.
All of those application need to be containerized to be deployed with kubernetes in minikube. 
Within this directory , we are going to create devcontainers , usually used by developers , with the environment we need to work.

# FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO WRITE CODE IN PYTHON

You can just see the basic_command.py , a simple script made to have an idea of how python manage data and how you can use it to manage your data.

# NOW WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS FLASK AND HOW IT WORKS

Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It provides tools, libraries, and technologies for building web applications, and it follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard.

Now with flask you can do a lot of things , but we just want to use it for routing and DB connection , so we will use SQLalchemy , a pyhton library that allows you to create a connection to a db.

Our python application is very simple and is based on a table inside a database where we are going to record the tasks to be done , the status of the tasks can be "to do", "in progress" and "done".

Inside the app.py file we used environment variables to record db connection data ( temporary procedure , in production we will use docker to set environment variables) , after that we created a class that would define the table and its attributes on which we want to operate , we defined three different routes : '/ ', '/insert' and '/advance' respectively to display the tasks inside the table , to insert new tasks and to advance the state of the tasks
