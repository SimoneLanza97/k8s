# DEVELOP A DOCKER IMAGE FOR YOUR APPLICATION 
In this directory we will create our private docker registry and our custom docker image , after which we will upload it to the private registry for later use with Minikube.

## CREATE THE REGISTRY
To create a private registry we will use docker's image registry , which allows us to have a container containing within it an image registry that will be available only to us, so that we can upload our custom images into it without them being accessible to anyone. 
Use the following command to pull the docker image: 
        
        docker pull registry:latest

And use this command to run it (the command run a container named registry , based on registry image , and forward the guest's port 5000 with the host port 5000):

        docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:latest

Now, if you use the command :

        docker ps 

You will see :

        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
2ed10fb78b47   registry:latest   "/entrypoint.sh /etcâ€¦"   4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp   registry

## NOW WE NEED TO CREATE OUR CUSTOM IMAGE 
We need to create a Dockerfile where we put our application and we can use docekr compose to test if the image is builded in the right way
